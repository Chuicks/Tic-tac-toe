# Tic-tac-toe
 
This is a java app that plays Tic tac toe. 
It has 2 separate modes: a single player and a two player mode.
- The single player will make the player play against a tic tac toe playing algorithm that cannot lose.
- The two player mode will allow both players to place their own X's and O's on the board.

There is a reset button that will allow the state of the game to reset but it won't change the gamemode.
